### Thrid parties:-
 - CoreUI Free Angular 2+ Admin Template;- CoreUI is an Open Source Bootstrap Admin Template. But CoreUI is not just another Admin Template. It goes way beyond hitherto admin templates thanks to transparent code and file structure. And if that's not enough, letâ€™s just add that CoreUI consists bunch of unique features and over 1000 high quality icons.

### ToDo

Listing here some of the ToDo that i would like to jump to if i had more time:

- Move all URLs to webconfig.json file to enable change all urls in production mode.
- Handle invalid formatted input json and show toast or error message.
- Extend sorting functionality to work on other columns. Currently It's is implemented for the name and status column only.
- Pagination is implemented on client but it's better to move it to the server side.
- Added more unit tests to cover all project.
- Added e2e test so we could test all solution.
